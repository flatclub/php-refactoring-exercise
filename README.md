PHP Refactoring Exercise Guidelines
===================================

* Clone this repo with your github account
* Make commits into it, push it to your github account and let us know your account_name/repo_name when you are finished
* You cannot use frameworks
* The evaluation will be based on the refactoring of code smells. e.g. duplicated code or very long methods
