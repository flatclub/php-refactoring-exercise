PHP Refactoring Exercise Guidelines
===================================

* Fork this repo with your github account
* Make commits into it, push it to your github account and let us know your account_name/repo_name when you are finished
* You can use whatever library you want
* The evaluation will be based on the refactoring steps and, but not only, on the final result.
